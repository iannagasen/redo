What should I do today?

# .01: Automate building using make

Design

1. Install make

```bash
choco install make -y
```

what do I need to automate?

- starting the server
    - frontend and backend

using k8s

- this is on windows, so I need local setup . minikube

mvp: is the backend first

SEQUENCE:

1. run `docker-compose-build-core-services.yaml` before running the pod in k8s
    - Why we need docker still? because this is local development
        - we want the pod image to point to local not in dockerhub
        - we may used dockerhub in the future, but this is good for now
    - we may need to rebuild the gradle project first actually, then rebuild docker image
2. run the pod

# .02: Dockerize front end, so that I can fully run the architecture in one `make` command

Design:

1. create the Dockerfile for the angular app
    - https://docs.docker.com/guides/angular/containerize/
2. add the entry in `docker-compose-build-core-services.yaml`
3. add other backend services in `docker-compose-build-core-services.yaml`
4. test and run `make`
