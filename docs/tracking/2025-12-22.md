Tasks

- [ ] Connect the dots using from frontend to backend (vv.)
    - [ ] **DEVOPS**: Create a k8s service object
        - DNS Resolution:
            - Why? pods are ephemeral and their IP addresses change
            - assign it to a stable cluster IP that never change
                - Three Dns formats
                    - `backend-service` - Shortest, works if both services are in the same namespace
                    - `backend-service.prod` - Needed when frontend is in dev namespace but needs to call backend in
                      prod namespace
                    - `backend-service.prod.svc.cluster.local` - Full FQDN, most explicit, works everywhere
    - [ ] **FRONTEND**: use environment variables for backend urls
    - [ ] **BACKEND** check CQRS config, need to allow requests from the frontend origin
        - [ ] **BACKEND** API gateway
